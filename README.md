Preprocessing questionnaires

Before running the script the data needs to be adjusted in ALL files in the following ways:

1. PS03_01: Responses (all in mins) before the 17.05.21 need to be recoded with the following code:

    •  ≤15 min = 1  
    •  16 - 30 min = 2                                                  
    •  31 - 59 min = 3    
    •  >60 min = 4  
    
2. PS05_01: Round all responses (all in hours) to 0.5, use a period (.) instead of a comma (,) and only type the number itself (e.g 7 oder 7.5)
3. PS
